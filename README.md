## Get Started

_EntE_ was born to make handling excuses and absent hours at schools less painful.
When a student misses a lesson, he goes online to create a new entry that lists the respective lessons and their respective teachers.
On submission, his parents and his manager receive an email requesting to pass the entry.
When both parties pass the entry by giving their digital signature, the entry is completed.
Teachers don't take part in this flow, but are able to see their students missed lessons.
