title: Prefiling Slots
---

Teachers can use EntE as a replacement for their records on missing students.
Use the navigation bar to open the "Slots" page and click on the big, blue "+"-button in the bottom right corner.
This will open the slot prefiling form.

Now enter date and time of the current class and add the missing students.
Upon submitting the form, corresponding new slots will appear in your slots table.
The missing students will be notified about their missed class and can include those
in their entries.

Slots that haven't been included are marked using a hour glass symbol in the "state" column.
