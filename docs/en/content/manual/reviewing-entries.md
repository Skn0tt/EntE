# Reviewing entries ...

In order for an entry to be accepted, both a manager and a parent needs to review and sign it.

## ... as a parent

You don't need to review every entry.
If you created them yourself or the entry's student is adult, your (parental) approval is given implicitly.

If this is not the case, you will receive a notification email about every new entry.
It contains a hyperlink that will open the new entry on EntE.

After opening the link, you first have to log in using your EntE credentials.
Now you can see the new entry.
Review it thoroughly.
If you want to approve it, click on the green _Sign_-Button.
You will now receive another notification via E-Mail.

## ... as a manager

You have to review every entry of your students.
They can be accessed on the "Entries" page that can be found in the navigation bar.
Unsigned entries are marked by red crosses.
By clicking on one of them, you open a detailed screen about it.

After reviewing the entry, you can take one of these actions:

- Sign the entry by clicking on the green "Sign"-Button
- Delete the entry by clicking on the tray icon in the upper right corner
- Send an email to the student by clicking on the email icon in the upper right corner
- Open the statistics of the student (bottom center)

If you want to revert your signature, you can do this by pressing the (now red) "Sign"-Button.
**Beware:** Some teachers could already have adopted the signature into theyr records.
