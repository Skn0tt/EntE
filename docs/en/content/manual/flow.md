This page aims to describe the workflow using EntE.

It is centered about the entry, which models a student's absence.

This can be created by either a student or their parents and contains the following information:

- date / timespan of the absence
- reason
- missed classes (including the corresponding teachers)

Upon creation, this entry is visible in the system.
In order to complete it, it has to be reviewed and signed by both a manager and a parent.

If the entry was created by a parent or the student is adult, parental approval is given implicitly.
If this is not the case, the parents will be notified of the new entry via email.
They now have a configurable timespan to review and sign the entry (14 days by default).
When parents sign an entry, they will receive another notification by email in order to prevent fraud.

Additionally, a manager needs to review and sign each entry.
If an entry is not permitted, it can be deleted.
If the manager approves it, they sign it.
A manager's signature can be revoked.

Missed classes can be seen by the corresponding teachers upon creation.
They can see wether it is due to an educational reason or not, but not the exact reason or the other missed classes.
They are also able to see if the entry was accepted so they can copy it into their own records.
