# Contributing to EntE

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

## How to Contribute

First, create an issue stating the problem and wait for an answer so you can be sure nobody else works on the same issue.
Then, fork the Repo and make your fixes.
After testing them (consider implementing Unit- or E2E-Tests, for Bug-Fixes a Regression Test would be great), create a merge request.
I will happily review and merge the request!

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

Required Dependencies:

- Node.js
- Yarn
- Docker

To start a local development instance, run `yarn install` to fetch dependencies and then `yarn dev` to start the development server.
