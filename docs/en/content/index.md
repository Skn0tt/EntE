# EntE

_EntE_ is an administration tool for schools to manage absence hours of students.

EntE was born to make handling excuses and absent hours at schools less painful.
When a student misses a lesson, he goes online to create a new entry that lists the respective lessons and their respective teachers.
On submission, his parents and his manager receive an email requesting to pass the entry.
When both parties pass the entry by giving their digital signature, the entry is completed.
Teachers don't take part in this flow, but are able to see their students missed lessons.

For a working demo instance, have a look at my development server: [https://demo.ente.app](https://demo.ente.app) (User: admin, Pass: root).

If you work at a school and wonder how this would fit into your workflow, feel free to contact me at [info@ente.app](mailto:info@ente.app).
